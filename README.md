**Backend engineer. 13 years of shipping products.**

I build systems that handle money, scale under pressure, and don't page you at 3am.

### What I believe

**Ship first, optimize later.** The best architecture is the one your team can maintain at 2am.

**Monoliths aren't dirty words.** Most systems don't need microservices - they need clear boundaries.

**Code is liability.** The best feature is the one you don't have to build.

<summary><b>A bit more about me</b></summary>
<br>

When I'm not writing code, I'm behind a camera - art, fashion, and documentary photography.

I've worked in startups from Lviv to Amsterdam. I've seen codebases that should've stayed prototypes and prototypes that became products serving millions.

The common thread? Pragmatism beats cleverness. Every time.
